#   description:
#       this file implements the DecisionMaker class for COSC494's Project 4 assignment.
#       the class facilitates decision-making by applying Hough transforms to identify
#       orbs in Slither.io game screen. The class'es primary use is the "generate_decision"
#       method that takes an image as input to generate a navigational decision (e.g., "N"
#       for North).
#
#   usage:
#       this class can be used as follows:
#
#           d = DecisionMaker([250,250]) // (250,250) is the location of the snake in your screenshot.
#           decision = d.generate_decision(img)
#
#   note:
#       you cannot modify this file for Project 4.
